### Overview
---

Study the temporal evolution of word usage in article titles or 
What does the fluctuation of word usage look like?



### Word Frequency Variations In Different Disciplines
---

Identify the word usage fluctuations in different disciplines and see their vatiations across time
and across disciplines.
For each discipline and year, consider the set of words that appear with frequency k, what is the 
distribution of the change in word frequencies in the next year?

### Curve Fitting
---

- Can we identify a distribution from which these fluctuations would have generated?
- Experimenting with the possion and negative binomial fits can be found
  [here](https://github.com/srjit/science-of-genius-title-impact/tree/master/src/7.%20Temporal%20Word%20Variations/word%20variations%20-%20curve%20fitting).
- Visual validation of goodness of fit
