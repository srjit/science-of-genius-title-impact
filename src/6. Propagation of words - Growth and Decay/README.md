### Overview
---

How does growth and decay of words (concepts) happen?
    
### Subproblem: How do we identify concept words from the  words that form list of publication titles?
---

- Method 1: Constructing the Term Frequency | Document Frequency graph and picking words
- Method 2: Adopting ideas from the publication [Entropic
  selection of concepts unveils hidden topics in documents corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06510), we construct an Average TF |
  Entropy plot and picking words.
    
### Subproblem: Plot trajectories of the selected words
---

 Use the concept words identified from the methods above and identify patterns in the trajectories.
