These notebooks show bringing in different sources data together for analysis. The sources include

    - category data (For the discipline)
    - article data (For the article/publication details)
    - citation data (For the citation details)
    
Note: Citation data is huge and is hard to process altogether. So the data is read in batches here
(2. citation-save-data) and is merged at the end.
